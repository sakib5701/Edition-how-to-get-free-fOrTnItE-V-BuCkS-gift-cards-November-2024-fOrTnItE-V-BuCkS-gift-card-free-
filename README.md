While you can purchase V-Bucks for real-world money, codes can occasionally be redeemed that can provide you with the currency for free.

Are there any free codes this month?
As of October 31, 2024, there are still no active V-Bucks codes, but this page will be updated as soon as any working codes show up.

Free codes in Fortnite are occasionally released in bunches, but most of them give out emotes, free Fortnite skins, or any of the game’s various cosmetics rather than V-Bucks which are hard to come by.

Note: Be wary of searching for free codes online, as there are a lot of potential scams out there.

How much do V-Bucks cost?
V-Bucks in Fortnite can be purchased with real money. In US currency, one V-Buck is equivalent to around $0.0079900. However, the total price may change depending on how many you buy at once. For example, 1000 V-Bucks will cost you $8.99 / €8.99.

Exchange rates also affect this, meaning that depending on the country you play from, the price of V-Bucks may vary.

What can you spend V-Bucks on?
Spider-Woman bundle in Fortnite.

The Spider-Woman 6-item bundle was released into the Item Shop during Fortnitemares 2024.
While the most popular use for V-Bucks is for buying character skins, that’s not all they’re used for. Players can also grab exclusive pickaxes, weapon wraps, and brand-new emotes with these elusive coins.

On top of that, they are also used to purchase this season’s Battle Pass. Each pass costs 950 V-Bucks but provides a treasure trove of new and exclusive content that you can’t unlock elsewhere in the game.

Remember that you can also use a Refund Request to get V-Bucks back for unwanted skin or cosmetics within 30 days of purchasing. Each player gets three a year, so make sure to use them carefully.
